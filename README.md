## Why?

Please note that this section is a work-in-progress.

### Time-orientation

Time is one of the largest obstacles to having *elegant*, *efficient*, *powerful* software in space. The Y2K bug is a 
prime example of how time-dependant computers have been and still are. In an environment where a day is more than 24
hours, software may not behave as expected.

## Us

So who are we?

We are SEMC. A team sprouted from [Nexus Aurora](#nexus-aurora), our goal in its entirety is to write software and ease
the development of space exploration. 

### Nexus Aurora



## Contributing

Obtain the source by cloning this repository, and building from the [build instructions](#building).

 - [ ] (Dynamic) Memory management
